# Optimizing the Shifted Rosenbrock Function


## Requirements :

In order to execute the optimization you will need:

1.  Pygmo : 2.16.0
2.  Numpy
3.  Pandas
4.  Matplotlib

## Instructions :

The notebook uses some shared functions that are stored in the following python scripts files:

 - shifted_go.py * # shifted global optimum of the functions
 - algorithms.py * # optimization algorithms customized utils.py #
 - functions used to summarise the results

Make sure to copy this files before running the cells of the notebook.

## Results:

The results will be reported for dimensions 50 and 500 considering:

- The chosen algorithm and a justification of this choice
- The parameters of the algorithm
- The final results, both solution and fitness
- The number of function evaluations
- The stopping criterion
- The computational time
- The convergence curve (fitness as a function of time)
